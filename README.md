Dynamic Asset Allocation Strategy

Overview

This project implements a dynamic asset allocation strategy that adjusts portfolio weights based on market conditions, risk tolerance, and expected returns. The approach uses a combination of Machine Learning (ML) for stock weight predictions, macroeconomic indicators for adjusting bond and commodity allocations, and a linear algebra-based method to determine category weight distributions.

Process Breakdown

Market Conditions Analysis

Uses indicators like VIX (Volatility Index), GDP growth, and yield spread to adjust sector weights dynamically.

Defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples) increase allocation in times of economic downturns.

Stock Selection via Machine Learning

Stocks are ranked using momentum and volatility metrics.

Weights are assigned based on normalized momentum scores.

Category Allocation via Linear Algebra

Determines weights for stocks, bonds, cash, and commodities using a structured matrix-based approach.

Risk tolerance affects the proportion allocated to stocks vs. more stable assets.

Risk-Based Return Adjustment

If high risk tolerance is selected, stocks are adjusted slightly above the efficient frontier to target higher returns.

Adjusts expected return by an alpha parameter based on risk preference.

Mathematical Formulation

1. Stock Weights

Stock weight, , is calculated as:



where  is the scaled momentum score for each stock.

2. Category Allocation

Category weight vector, , is obtained via:



where:

 represents the category constraint matrix.

 is the total available investment budget.

3. Adjusted Return Target

For high-risk users:



where:

 is the adjusted target return.

 is the efficient frontier return.

 is an adjustment factor (+0.02 for high risk, -0.01 for low risk).

Roadmap

Phase 1: Implement base ML model for stock selection (Done ‚úÖ)

Phase 2: Enhance macroeconomic integration for asset category weighting (In Progress üõ†Ô∏è)

Phase 3: Optimize risk-adjusted return calculation

Phase 4: Backtest and refine the dynamic allocation model

Conclusion

This strategy provides a flexible approach to asset allocation, balancing data-driven insights with user-defined risk preferences. The combination of ML, macroeconomic analysis, and structured allocation methods ensures adaptability to different market conditions.
